At the end of 2020, I decided to start learning programming languages (JavaScript), 
because this is one of the several areas that is related to my main specialty. 
My main goal is to gain practical and theoretical knowledge that will be needed 
to work and develop in the field of programming. 
My most notable traits are perseveranse and patience. They always help me out 
when "things don't go as planned" and in difficult situations, I always try not to lose my head, 
but to remain calm and think about how to fix everything. I also have a quality that helped me 
a lot during my studies at the university - the ability to self-study 
and independently look for ways to solve problems.

Theoretical basis of JavaScript (variables, basic math operators, if/else, functions).

```
const func = (num) => {  
  if (num > 0) {  
    return num - 1;  
  }
  return num + 1;  
};  
```
I graduated from the Bratsk State University in 2020 and got a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering Technology.

It is difficult for me to assess my knowledge of the English language. 
At university and in real life, I had no conversation practice at all. On the other hand, 
I use English every day, and I watch and read most of the content in English. Moreover, 
if in-depth technical vocabulary is not often used in lectures / blogs, 
I do not use subtitles and translators.

I would like to add that, despite the lack of speaking practice, I am not ashamed to speak 
even with mistakes in pronunciation and a strongly audible accent. 
The language barrier won't be a problem for me.

My assessment of my level of English at the moment:
writing: 5/10
listening: 7-8 / 10
speaking: 3/10
